If time permits, conduct an ice-breaking activity to allow participants to introduce themselves. You can use the &ldquo;popcorn&rdquo; approach, where the last person to participate selects the next teammate to introduce themselves.</p>\n<p>Keep introductions plain and straightforward by encouraging participants to answer two or three questions, such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is your name?</li>\n<li>How long have you been in the Cardano Community?</li>\n<li>Why do you want to become a DRep?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The &ldquo;popcorn&rdquo; approach is a double-edged sword; however, it makes the meeting more democratic, with each team member selecting their successor. However, it can also make people feel awkward if they are unfamiliar with one another.

A suggested approach to allowing participants a more profound understanding is to use the &ldquo;students-produced question&rdquo; approach. Asking questions is challenging, and participants can do deep thinking and learning by developing questions (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022487109339906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Franke et al., 2009</a>). Instead of asking participants questions about the roles to check if they understand them, encourage them to read the definitions and formulate their own questions about each role. This practice engages participants' working and long-term memory (<a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780203781197/memory-brain-magda-arnold\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arnold, 1984</a>).</p>\n<p>After presenting the governance roles, briefly describe the processes attained to each role. Point out that the support tools for each role will be explained later.</p>\n<p>Finally, explain the overall governance action enactment process. Recall that CIP-1694 describes seven types of governance actions that can be proposed by ada holders and voted by the governance roles with voting rights (DRep, SPO, and CC member).</p>\n<p>As a proposed engagement strategy, you can create groups representing each role with voting rights and simulate voting under different scenarios using flashcards or sticky notes to record votes.</p>\n<p>Ensure there are no pending questions before moving on to the next activity</p>",

The teacher leads by posing thought-provoking questions. Students actively engage by asking questions of their own. The discussion goes back and forth.</p>\n<p>You can start the discussion by posing questions, such as:</p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li>What do you understand as &ldquo;delegation&rdquo; in Cardano&rsquo;s ecosystem context?</li>\n<li>Are you familiar with delegation outside of Cardano&rsquo;s ecosystem?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are no right or wrong answers. The idea is to check participants' pulse around the meaning of delegation to set a baseline before explaining why delegation is important in the context of Cardano&rsquo;s Governance.</p>\n<p>Explain why delegation is necessary and how it is used in several liquid democracy applications.</p>\n<p>Next, under the context of delegating voting rights to DReps, check participants' pulse on the following questions:</p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li>Why not direct voting instead of delegation?</li>\n<li>Does delegation help?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Figure out scenarios that can illustrate the rationing proposed in the slides.</p>\n<p>When the discussion ends, ensure there are no pending questions before moving on to the next activity.</p>",
