In your role as design engineers, use the engineering-design process and geometric modeling to redesign a product's packaging to render it more sustainable. Explore volume, surface area, and dimensions of complex shapes to develop prototypes that meet the product's packaging design constraints while limiting the packaging material used and/or waste generated.",
